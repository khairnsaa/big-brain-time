// Problem
// Given an array of strings words and a string s, determine if s is an acronym of words.

// The string s is considered an acronym of words if it can be formed by concatenating the first character of each string in words in order. For example, "ab" can be formed from ["apple", "banana"], but it can't be formed from ["bear", "aardvark"].

// Return true if s is an acronym of words, and false otherwise.

 

// Example 1:

// Input: words = ["alice","bob","charlie"], s = "abc"
// Output: true
// Explanation: The first character in the words "alice", "bob", and "charlie" are 'a', 'b', and 'c', respectively. Hence, s = "abc" is the acronym.

// solution
var isAcronym = function(words, s) {
    let firstLetter = ''

    for(let i=0; i<words.length; i++){
        firstLetter += words[i][0]
    }
    if(firstLetter===s) return true
    else return false
    
};
